1. A program to access a protected method of a class in different package:

In Java if you want to access a method which is declared as protected in a different package, 
you can access it by Inheritance.

package package1;

public class session4 {

	public void protectedMethod() {
		System.out.println("Inside Method with PROTECTED Modifier");
	}
}

package package2;

import package1.session4;

public class session4_AccessMethod {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		session4 session4Object = new session4();
 		session4Object.protectedMethod();
}

}



Result :

Inside Method with PROTECTED Modifier
